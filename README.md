# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with Color Theme Switcher

This is my solution to
the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).
The goal was to build a fully responsive application that lets users browse country data, filter by region, and switch
between light and dark themes.

## My Process

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I Learned

This was my first project using **TypeScript with React**, and it really helped me understand:

- How to strongly type props
- How to use Tailwindâ€™s `dark:` variants for theme switching
- How to build reusable components with proper types
- How to give **types to React hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`, `ContextApi` etc.

Example of dark mode implementation using Tailwind:

```tsx
function Detail({head, detail}: DetailPropsType) {
    return <div className="flex gap-2 items-center">
        <h6 className="text-sm font-medium ">
            {head}:
        </h6>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
            {Array.isArray(detail) ? detail.join(", ") : detail}
        </p>
    </div>
}
